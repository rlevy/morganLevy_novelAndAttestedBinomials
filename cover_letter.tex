\opening{Dear Professor Altmann:}

This submission contains the manuscript ``Abstract knowledge versus direct experience in processing of binomial expressions'', which we are submitting to
Cognition for publication.
The manuscript reports original research on word order preferences for \emph{binomial expressions} of the form \emph{A and B} (e.g. \emph{bread and butter}), combining probabilistic modeling with human comprehension experiments (self-paced reading and forced-choice preference). Among other results, we demonstrate for the first time that online processing of never-before-seen binomials is influenced by ordering constraints referencing the semantic, phonological, and lexical properties of the constituent words. Moreover, we contribute to the theoretical debate over the storage and processing of frequent multi-word expressions: by quantifying the competing influences of abstract combinatorial knowledge and direct experience with specific binomial expressions, we demonstrate that reliance upon each of these two competing knowledge sources changes as a function of frequency of direct experience with a given expression.


This manuscript is not under consideration for publication in any
other venue.  Please let us know if there is any further information
you need in connection with this submission.  We look forward to
hearing from you regarding the manuscript!  \closing{Yours truly,}

\end{letter}
